### Reporting Bugs
This section guides you through submitting a bug report or an issue with one of the script published in this repository. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible and make sure you run the script with Debug and Verbose logging (In all PowerShell scripts just add '-Debug -Verbose' at the end of the script command).

**Note**: If you find a Closed issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

**Before Submitting A Bug Report**
Run the script with Verbose logging.
Perform a cursory search to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
